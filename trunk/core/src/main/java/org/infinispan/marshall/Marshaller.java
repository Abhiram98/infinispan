/**
 * A marshaller is a class that is able to marshall and unmarshall objects efficiently.
 * <p/>
 * The reason why this is implemented specially in Infinispan rather than resorting to Java serialization or even the
 * more efficient JBoss serialization is that a lot of efficiency can be gained when a majority of the serialization
 * that occurs has to do with a small set of known types such as {@link org.infinispan.transaction.GlobalTransaction} or
 * {@link org.infinispan.commands.ReplicableCommand}, and class type information can be replaced with simple magic
 * numbers.
 * <p/>
 * Unknown types (typically user data) falls back to JBoss serialization.
 * <p/>
 * In addition, using a marshaller allows adding additional data to the byte stream, such as context class loader
 * information on which class loader to use to deserialize the object stream, or versioning information to allow streams
 * to interoperate between different versions of Infinispan (see {@link VersionAwareMarshaller}
 * <p/>
 * This interface is used to marshall {@link org.infinispan.commands.ReplicableCommand}s, their parameters and their
 * response values.
 * <p/>
 * The interface is also used by the {@link org.infinispan.loaders.CacheStore} framework to efficiently serialize data
 * to be persisted, as well as the {@link org.infinispan.statetransfer.StateTransferManager} when serializing the cache
 * for transferring state en-masse.

    * 
    * <p>This method also takes a boolean that represents whether this particular call to startObjectOutput() is reentrant 
    * or not. A call to startObjectOutput() should be marked reentrant whenever a 2nd or more calls to this method are made 
    * without having called finishObjectOutput() first.     
    * 
    * <p>To potentially speed up calling startObjectOutput multiple times in a non-reentrant way, i.e. 
    * startObjectOutput/finishObjectOutput...startObjectOutput/finishObjectOutput...etc, which is is the most common case, the 
    * Marshaller implementation could potentially use some mechanisms to speed up this startObjectOutput call. 
    *  
    * <p>On the other hand, when a call is reentrant, i.e. startObjectOutput/startObjectOutput(reentrant)...finishObjectOutput/finishObjectOutput, 
    * the Marshaller implementation might treat it differently. An example of reentrancy would be marshalling of {@link MarshalledValue}. 
    * When sending or storing a MarshalledValue, a call to startObjectOutput() would occur so that the stream is open and 
    * following, a 2nd call could occur so that MarshalledValue's raw byte array version is calculated and sent accross. 
    * This enables lazy deserialization on the receiver side which is performance gain. The Marshaller implementation could decide 
    * that it needs a separate ObjectOutput or similar for the 2nd call since it's aim is only to get the raw byte array version 
    * and the close finish with it.</p>
