/**
 * A <tt>CacheManager</tt> is the primary mechanism for retrieving a {@link org.infinispan.Cache} instance, and is often
 * used as a starting point to using the {@link org.infinispan.Cache}.
 * <p/>
 * <tt>CacheManager</tt>s are heavyweight objects, and we foresee no more than one <tt>CacheManager</tt> being used per
 * JVM (unless specific configuration requirements require more than one; but either way, this would be a minimal and
 * finite number of instances).
 * <p/>
 * Constructing a <tt>CacheManager</tt> is done via one of its constructors, which optionally take in a {@link
 * org.infinispan.config.Configuration} or a path or URL to a configuration XML file.
 * <p/>
 * Lifecycle - <tt>CacheManager</tt>s have a lifecycle (it implements {@link org.infinispan.lifecycle.Lifecycle}) and
 * the default constructors also call {@link #start()}.  Overloaded versions of the constructors are available, that do
 * not start the <tt>CacheManager</tt>, although it must be kept in mind that <tt>CacheManager</tt>s need to be started
 * before they can be used to create <tt>Cache</tt> instances.
 * <p/>
 * Once constructed, <tt>CacheManager</tt>s should be made available to any component that requires a <tt>Cache</tt>,
 * via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface">JNDI</a> or via some other mechanism
 * such as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a> framework.
 * <p/>
 * You obtain <tt>Cache</tt> instances from the <tt>CacheManager</tt> by using one of the overloaded
 * <tt>getCache()</tt>, methods.  Note that with <tt>getCache()</tt>, there is no guarantee that the instance you get is
 * brand-new and empty, since caches are named and shared.  Because of this, the <tt>CacheManager</tt> also acts as a
 * repository of <tt>Cache</tt>s, and is an effective mechanism of looking up or creating <tt>Cache</tt>s on demand.
 * <p/>
 * When the system shuts down, it should call {@link #stop()} on the <tt>CacheManager</tt>.  This will ensure all caches
 * within its scope are properly stopped as well.
 * <p/>
 * Sample usage: <code> CacheManager manager = new DefaultCacheManager("my-config-file.xml"); Cache entityCache =
 * manager.getCache("myEntityCache"); entityCache.put("aPerson", new Person());
 * <p/>
 * Configuration myNewConfiguration = new Configuration(); myNewConfiguration.setCacheMode(Configuration.CacheMode.LOCAL);
 * manager.defineConfiguration("myLocalCache", myNewConfiguration); Cache localCache = manager.getCache("myLocalCache");
 * </code>
